I will soon be out of green tea, kind of panicking.
Other than that I can't decide which one to buy next.
I've read that gyokuro has very good and umami flavour
but it is expensive. I will probably buy gunpowder and more sencha.

edit: "pounce" from #tea channel tilde.chat just have recommend me Lung Chin and Golden Monkey tea, I'll update here how it turns out
