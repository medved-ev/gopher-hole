Some goated bands
As time of writing this, I'm mostly listening to sludge/doom metal and grindcore.
If you like music of the slower tempo I would highly recommend to give Bongripper
a try and if you haven't yet, listen to Crowbar, especially to their album "Time heals nothing".
If you like something little faster give Iron Lung a try, I would honestly recommend "Cold storage II".
Also give Haggus a try, all albums are great but maybe best ones are "Mince That Fucker" and their most
famous "An Epitaph For Mankind"

I will likely be called a poser after publishing this,
since these bands have more than like 1 listener annually but I don't care.
Some bands get popular for a reason.
