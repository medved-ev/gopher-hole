Assam Kooming (black tea)
7/10, quite good as a morning tea,
it tastes like regular black tea
but little sweeter.

Sencha (green tea)
8/10, it has a very
fishy, umami taste to it.
I prefer more earthy teas usually
but I liked this one.

Mint tea
6/10, it's probably one of cheapest ones
it goes good with sweets but it ain't
really that good.

Melise tea
6/10, I used it to sleep better,
it haven't helped much, it has slightly
sweet taste
